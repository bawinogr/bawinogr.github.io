			Originally motivated to become a Radiologist, in college I became became fascinated by the role of Physics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). I joined a solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging Research group and became further motivated to understand the underlying quantum mechanics.  Moving to graduate school, I discovered the world of computational/theoretical chemistry and high performance computing.  I gained skills to explore quantum mechanics at the theoretical level.

                     As an AI Solutions Engineer and Technical Product Manager for a portfolio of AI products, I leverage my research background and technical expertise to bridge the gap between complex user needs and innovative solutions. My experience in computational research has equipped me with the analytical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for rapidly prototyping AI solutions and translating technical concepts for diverse stakeholders.

                     <br>
                     <br>
Working with technologies including Python, Palantir, TypeScript, SQL, and GCP, I specialize in quickly understanding user requirements, developing proof-of-concepts, and facilitating seamless communication between users and technical teams to architect scalable AI solutions. As a data scientist, I have prototyped and managed diverse AI systems including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations, multilingual classification models, text mining pipelines, fine-tuned language models, text-to-SQL bots, and more. I'm particularly passionate about identifying painless and simple solutions to complicated problemsâ€”finding elegant approaches that cut through complexity to deliver maximum impact with minimal friction.

                     <br>
                     <br>
My unique combination of deep technical knowledge from quantum mechanics and computational chemistry, paired with practical product management experience, allows me to approach AI challenges with both scientific rigor and business acuity. I'm passionate about making advanced AI technologies accessible and actionable for organizations, continuing to explore the intersection of cutting-edge research and real-world applications in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</div>
